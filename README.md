Home
====

This contains scripts I use to make myself feel at home when I'm in a foreign land.

Currently just has the following
* home.sh - Installs my .bashrc and adds my public key to authorized_keys
* bashrc - The .bashrc I like to use when away from home. Red prompt, timestamps, base dir, and history number, mmmm yes.
* key - My most commonly used id_rsa.pub

Preferred method of execution:

 wget vladionescu.com/home.sh && chmod +x home.sh && ./home.sh
